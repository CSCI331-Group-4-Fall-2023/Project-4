/**
 * @details
 * \n Reads a block of length-indicated records from a blocked file, which is
 *    passed to the buffer by reference in the constructor.
 * \n
 * \n  Each block starts with these five metadata fields:
 * \n  -- Length of metadata record (int)
 * \n  -- Relative Block Number (int)
 * \n  -- Number of records in the block (int)
 * \n  -- Previous Relative Block Number (int)
 * \n  -- Next Relative Block Number (int)
 * \n
 * \n The Relative Block Number (RBN) is used to navigate the file and starts
 *    at 0 for the first block. The Previous RBN and Next RBN are used to
 *    navigate the file in logical order. A Previous/Next RBN of -1 means the
 *    block is the first/last block.
 * \n
 * \n The records within each block are length-indicated and have no other
 *    delimiters. The length field is separated from the rest of the record
 *    by a comma delimiter.
